## Capstone_project
## Project Overview
AnomaData:
Many different industries need predictive maintenance solutions to reduce risks and gain actionable insights through processing data from their equipment.
Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing online monitoring. The goal is to perform maintenance before the equipment degrades or breaks down.
This Capstone project is mainly focused on predicting the machine breakdown by identifying the anomalies in the data. The dataset contains about 18000+ rows collected over few days. The column ‘y’ contains the binary labels (1 for anomaly and 0 for normal).

## Key Features
 *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
  Detailed analysis to understand data patterns, relationships, and trends.

 Data Cleaning: 
  Standardization, handling missing values, and outliers.

 Correcting date datatype:
  Selecting correct datatype for date.

 Model Training and Validation: 
  Implementing various machine learning models and evaluating their performance using choosen matrices.

 Install Dependencies
  pip install -r requirements.txt
